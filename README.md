## 1. Prerequisites

Before you start, you need three things:

### 💻 Computer Requirements
*   **OS**: Windows, Mac, or Linux.
*   **Node.js**: You must have Node.js installed (Version 18 or higher).
    *   [Download Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/) (Choose "LTS" version).
*   **Git**: Required to download the code.
    *   [Download Git here](https://git-scm.com/).

### 💰 Wallet Requirements
*   **A Polymarket Account**: Log in to [Polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com).
*   **USDC (Polygon)**: You need funds to trade.
    *   **USDC.e** is the specific token used on Polygon for Polymarket.
*   **MATIC (Polygon)**: You need a small amount ($1-$5) for gas fees.

### 🔑 Private Key
*   You need the **Private Key** of your wallet (e.g., from MetaMask or your Polymarket proxy wallet).
*   *Security Note: Never share this key with anyone.*

## 2. Installation

Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on Mac) and run these commands one by one.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Download the bot code to your computer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrFadiAi/Polymarket-bot.git
cd Polymarket-bot
```

*(Note: If you downloaded the ZIP file instead, just unzip it and open the folder in your terminal)*

### Step 2: Install Dependencies & Build Dashboard
This installs all the "parts" the bot needs to run and builds the dashboard interface.

```bash
# Install main dependencies
npm install

# Build the dashboard (Critical Step!)
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

*This process might take 1-3 minutes.*

---

## 3. Configuration

This is the most important step. We need to tell the bot your wallet details.

### Step 1: Create the .env File
1.  Find the file named `.env.example` in the folder.
2.  Copy it and rename the copy to `.env`.

### Step 2: Add Your Credentials
Open the `.env` file with any text editor (Notepad, VS Code) and fill in your details:

```env
# ==============================================
# 🔑 WALLET CONFIGURATION (REQUIRED)
# ==============================================

# Your Wallet Private Key (Export from MetaMask)
# Format: 0x...
POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYourPrivateKeyHere

# ==============================================
# ⚙️ BOT SETTINGS
# ==============================================

# DRY RUN MODE
# "true" = Simulation Mode (No real money used, SAFE to test)
# "false" = Live Trading (Real money used, BE CAREFUL)
DRY_RUN=true

# API Keys (Optional but recommended for speed)
# Get a free key from specific providers if you want better performance
# ALCHEMY_KEY=...
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Start with `DRY_RUN=true`. Only change it to `false` when you are 100% sure everything works.

---

## 4. Running the Bot

Now the fun part! Let's start the bot with the visual dashboard.

Run this command:

```bash
npx tsx bot-with-dashboard.ts
```

### What happens next?
1.  The terminal will show startup logs.
2.  It will verify your wallet connection.
3.  **The Dashboard will open automatically in your browser** at `http://localhost:3001`.

If it doesn't open, just click that link.

---

## 5. Dashboard Guide

The dashboard is your command center.

*   **Mode Indicator**: Shows if you are in **🔴 LIVE** or **🟢 DRY RUN** mode.
*   **Balances**: Reat-time view of your MATIC and USDC.
*   **PnL Panel**: Tracks your Profit and Loss per session.
*   **Quick Actions**: Buttons to instantly stop strategies or panic sell.

## 6. Strategies Explained

The bot comes with 4 powerful strategies. You can toggle them ON/OFF in the dashboard.

### 1. ⚖️ Arbitrage
*   **Concept**: Finds markets where `YES Price + NO Price < $1.00`.
*   **Action**: Buys both sides immediately.
*   **Profit**: Guaranteed math-based profit when the market resolves to $1.00.
*   **Risk**: Extremely Low.

### 2. 📉 DipArb (Dip Arbitrage)
*   **Concept**: Watches for panic selling in 15-minute crypto markets (BTC, ETH).
*   **Trigger**: If price crashes >15% in 3 seconds.
*   **Action**: Buys the dip (Leg 1) and hedges with the opposite side (Leg 2).

### 3. 🐋 Smart Money
*   **Concept**: Tracks the top profitable traders on the leaderboard.
*   **Action**: Copies their trades automatically.
*   **Settings**: You can configure how much to copy relative to their size.

### 4. ⚡ Direct Trading
*   **Concept**: Tools for manual trading with super-powers.
*   **Features**:
    *   **FOK (Fill or Kill)**: Ensures your whole order fills or cancels (no partial fills).
    *   **Sniper**: Quick buy buttons slightly above market price to ensure entry.

## 7. Troubleshooting

**"Command not found" error?**
*   Make sure you installed Node.js. Restart your computer if you just installed it.

**"Connection Failed"?**
*   Check your internet.
*   Verify your `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY` is correct in `.env`.

**"Insufficient Funds"?**
*   You need both USDC (for trades) and MATIC (for gas) on the **Polygon Network**.

## 8. Safety & Risks

1.  **Private Keys**: Your key gives full access to your funds. Keep it safe.
2.  **Start Small**: Use Dry Run first. Then try with small amounts ($10-$50).
3.  **Monitor**: Do not leave the bot running unmonitored for days until you trust it.
